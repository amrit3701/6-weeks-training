\subsection{Shell Scripting}
Because all my project work was being done in Ubuntu (i.e. a Linux distribution), I came to know the power of Bash(Terminal). We can simply call it a "Shell". It is a great tool to work faster. With terminal, the efficiency of work increases. Ubuntu uses the Bash(Bourne Again Shell) as default shell. During training, I came to know about the new commands daily. Working with CLI(Command Line Interface) is a fun.
